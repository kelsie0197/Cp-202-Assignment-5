<h3>Changes</h3>
<p>The following changes were made in relation to our conceptual design:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Navigation: Initially we wanted to do a column navigation but we resorted to a horizontal navigation because we like the overall look.</li><br>
    <li>Factorization Tab: We felt that factorization is an extremely elementary skill that it was not necessary to provide a whole section on it.</li><br>
    <li>Completing the Square Tab: Like factorization, completing the squares is a very basic skill that would be as beneficial as derivatives for example.</li>
    <li>Worked example for Log properties, and trigonometric identities: Since Log properties, and trigonometric identities are a highschool concept, they are essentially refresher sections. With that being said we did not include a worked example since all they really need is a reference to recall the properties.</li>
</ul>
